Release Notes
--------------
This version of the library has been tested under OSX 10.3.9 PPC and OSX 10.4.8 Intel.

While the makefiles will make a .dylib and a .a, it is recommended to simply staticly link with the .a file.

FreeImage is now built as a Universal Binary and targets the 10.3.9 SDK for PPC and the 10.4u SDK for i386.
This means that you must have both of these SDKs installed and that you must be running on OSX 10.4+ to build FreeImage.
The library will run on 10.3 PPC, but probably not 10.2 or below anymore. wchar.h did not exist on 10.2.

Building the Library
--------------------
The build process is as simple as this: 
1) Enter the FreeImage directory
2) Build the distribution: 
make -f Makefile.osx
3) The libraries will be in the Dist directory when the build is finished

To install FreeImage in the /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include directories: 
make -f Makefile.osx install

To clean all files produced during the build process:
make -f Makefile.osx clean
