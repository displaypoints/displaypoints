2008-06-11  tylerrick

        * Made FileUtils#whereis a module_function again like it used to be. Because:
          (1) that seems to be the way most other FileUtils methods are (cd, mkdir, cp, ...) and the most obvious way that users would WANT to use FileUtils: FileUtils.whereis("ruby"). 
          (3) I see module_function used in other comparible parts of Facets: UploadUtils, ConsoleUtils, ZipUtils, FileUtils#safe_ln, ...
          (3) My code that relied on the old module_function behavior was breaking
          What were you thinkin changing it?? ;)
