Facets 2.5.0 is an important milestone in the development of Facets.

This release has been tested against Rails' ActiveSupport library.
As long as Facets is loaded after ActiveSupport, everything
should work fine. Of course, there's no counting for real world
trials, but all ActiveSupport testcases pass under this scenario.

Secondly, this release is the first of two (or three) down-scaling
releases intended to remove all the remaining "excess" from the
library. This is being done for a variety of reasons. Some scripts
are substantial enough to be one their own and have been spun-off
into separate largely compatible projects. In this release:

  If you were using...   Use this project instead...

    annotations.rb         Anise

    bytes.rb               RichUnits
    times.rb

    command.rb             Clio
    consoleutils.rb

A few others scripts have been deprecated, without an alternative
recourse, simply because they were too weak, such as  uploadutils.rb,
or highly experimental, such as chain.rb and eventhook.rb.

Although this release constitutes an over all slimming down of Facets,
two excellent new libraries have been added.

1) *ini.rb* by Jeena Paradies. While YAML is frequently used by
Rubyists for configuration files, a full-on serializer like YAML
is often overkill. INI files provide a lightweight solution
specifically geared for configuration.

2) *filter.rb* by Brian Candler offers lazy evaluation chains of 
Enumerable methods. This is an elegant way to optimize contiguous
maps, selections, etc. --effective even on infinite enumerators.
(Note, the name of this library may be changed in the next release.)

While work remains to be done, I am happy to say, Facets is 
finally beginning to approach the level of solidity I set out to
achieve just over a year ago. Thank the Maker!

Special thanks to Brian Candler, Jeena Paradies and Tyler Rick.

Enjoy!


### 2.5.0 / 2008-11-23

* 9 Major Changes

    * added Brian Candler's Enumerator::Filter
    * added sparse_array.rb (was old harray.rb)
    * added Jeena Paradies' ini.rb
    * renamed CacheDelegator to Memoizer
    * renamed DictionaryMatcher to just Matcher
    * deprecated bytes.rb and times.rb (use RichUnits instead)
    * deprecated uploadutils.rb; ziputils.rb will be (use Folio)
    * deprecated annotations.rb (use Anise instead)
    * deprecated command.rb and consoleutils.rb (use Clio instead)

* 5 Minor Changes

    * deprecated chain.rb (very expiremental)
    * deprecated eventhook.rb (moved to ToadCode project)
    * deprecated tagiter.rb (moved to ToadCode project)
    * moved Hash#symolize_keys and #stringify_keys to core lib
      (still recommend #rekey instead though)
    * switched to git as of 2.4.5

* 4 Bug Fixes

    * memoize.rb, cache was at class-level, now at instance-level
    * binding/caller.rb, fixed require for callstack.rb
    * fixed missing require in string/tabto.rb
    * Fixed some bugs with Time#ago/Time#hence not changing years
      correctly when you changed months.
      (For example, Time.utc(2008, 1, 1).ago(12, :months) incorrectly
      returned 2009-01-01 instead of 2007-01-01.)
      Changed Time#ago/Time#hence to still work if passed negative number.
